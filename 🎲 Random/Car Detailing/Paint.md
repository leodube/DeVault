## Wash
1. Wash car with Mr. Pink to remove surface dirt and grime.
2. Second wash with Clean Slate to strip old wax and sealants
3. Dry car with microfibre towel

## Clay Bar
1. Take a golf ball size amount of the clay bar and shape into a patty.
2. Spray clay bar with Clay Luber and spray paint generously.
3. Work the clay bar in straight motions (avoid circular motions) and ensure enough lubrication is used. Make sure not to apply any pressure (just the weight of your hand).
4. Once you feel paint get smooth, buff off excess lubricant and move on to another section.

## Polish
1. Determine the strength of the cutting compound and polishing pad.
2. Apply dime size drops of the polish to polishing pad. The number of drops you add should be the same number as the pad size, so a 6 inch pad receives 6 drops.
3. Blot out the polish onto the working area.
4. On low speed, use the polisher to work the polish into the working area.
5. Once evenly spread out, turn the polisher to a higher speed and continue working into the surface until translucent.
6. Continue over the surface of the vehicle.
7. Repeat with lighter cutting compounds as needed.

## Ceramics (optional)
1. Spray Hydro Charge onto a microfibre applicator. Hydro Charge can only be used on paint.
2. Apply to surface in a straight, cross-hatch pattern (avoid circular motions). Use 3-4 sprays per working area.
3. Once added to the working surface, wait 30 seconds to 1 minute and then lightly buff with a microfibre towel.
4. Once done applying the ceramic coating, wash the applicator immediately or throw out the applicator as the product will harden.
5. Wait 3 hours for Hydro Charge to bond before moving to the next step.
6. Apply 4 dots of Hydro Slick on to a new microfibre applicator. Hydro Slick can be used on paint, glass, headlights, and wheels.
7. Apply to surface in a straight, cross-hatch pattern (avoid circular motions).
8. Once added to the working surface, wait 30 seconds to 1 minute and then lightly buff with a clean microfibre towel.
9. Wait for 3 hours for Hydro Charge to bond before moving to the next step.

## Glaze
1. Apply dime size drops of the glaze to the polishing pad. The number of drops you add should be the same number as the pad size, so a 6 inch pad receives 6 drops.
2. Blot out the glaze onto the working area.
3. On low speed, use the polisher to spread the glaze over the working area. Do not work in to the paint. It should not take long to cover the area.
4. Continue over the surface of the vehicle.
5. Wait 10-15 minutes, then buff off with a microfibre towel.

## Sealant
1. Apply dime size drops of the sealant to the polishing pad. The number of drops you add should be the same number as the pad size, so a 6 inch pad receives 6 drops.
2. Blot out the sealant onto the working area.
3. On low speed, use the polisher to spread the sealant over the working area. Do not work in to the paint. It should not take long to cover the area.
4. Continue over the surface of the vehicle, including the glass.
5. Wait 10-15 minutes, then buff off with a microfibre towel.
