## Wash
1. Wash car with Mr. Pink to remove surface dirt and grime.
2. Second wash with Clean Slate to strip old wax and sealants
3. Dry car with microfibre towel

## Clay Bar
1. Take a golf ball size amount of the clay bar and shape into a patty.
2. Spray clay bar with Clay Luber and spray paint generously.
3. Work the clay bar in straight motions (avoid circular motions) and ensure enough lubrication is used. Make sure not to apply any pressure (just the weight of your hand).
4. Once you feel paint get smooth, buff off excess lubricant and move on to another section.

## Polish
1. Apply dime size drops to polishing pad. The number of drops you add should be the same number as the pad size, so a 6 inch pad receives 6 drops.
