Use processing to model a planter path.
- Randomly generate piece shapes
	- Convex Hull algorithm [1](https://cglab.ca/~sander/misc/ConvexGeneration/ValtrAlgorithm.java), [2](https://cglab.ca/~sander/misc/ConvexGeneration/convex.html)
- Back fill movement w/ random variation
- Tree counter + return to bagup + line in and line out
- Throw plots
- Override step distance
- Model how device will work

Device:
- PCB
- Bluetooth
- GPS (or on phone)
- Battery
- Casing + attachment

App:
- Set spacing distance
