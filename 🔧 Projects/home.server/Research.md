## Case Study
[Wolfgang's Power Efficient Home Server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MucGkPUMjNo&list=WL&index=41)

### Recommendations
- **Don't buy old hardware**
- **Newer doesn't necessarily mean more power efficient**

### Build
**CPU**
- Power saving is not as easy as buying a low TDP CPU and pairing with a motherboard
- 6th or 7th Intel CPU will be fairly power efficient and budget friendly
- Intel tends to win on power efficiency vs AMD 
- TDP means nothing for the real world power consumption of a home server as it only describes power consumption under load, so avoid T-Series Intel chips as they are more expensive with no real benefits.
- Things to look for: *Idle system power consumption*, *PassMark score*

- **Motherboard:**
