# Handling Technical Questions
Interviews are supposed to be difficult, so when you get a hard questions, don't panic. Just start talking aloud about how you would solve it. Show your interviewer how you're tackling the problem so that they don't think you're stuck.

You're not done until the interviewer says you're dont. When you come up with an algorithm, start thinking about the problems accompanying it. When you write code, start trying to find bugs.

##### Five Steps to a Technical Question
1.  Ask your interviewer questions to resolve ambiguity.
2. Design an algorithm
3. Write pseudocode first, but make sure to tell your interviewer that you'll eventually write "real" code
4. Write your code at a moderate pace
5. Test your code and carefully fix any mistakes
