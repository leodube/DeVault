# Project Title
This is the name of the project. It describes the whole project in one sentence, and helps people understand **what** the main goal and aim of the project is.

## Project Description
The quality of a README description often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase:
-   What your application does,
-   Why you used the technologies you used,
-   Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.

## Table of Contents (optional)
If your README is very long, you might want to add a table of contents to make it easy for users to navigate to different sections easily. It will make it easier for readers to move around the project with ease.

## How to Install and Run the Project
Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment set and running.

## How to Use the Project
Provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem – they will always have a place to reference what is expected.

## How to Contribute to the Project
This mostly will be useful if you are developing an open-source project that you will need other developers to contribute to. You will want to add guidelines to let them know how they can contribute to your project.

## Include Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide code examples and how to run them. This will help show that you are certain and confident that your project will work without any challenges, which will give other people confidence in it, too
