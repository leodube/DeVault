# 2. Add Two Numbers
#leetcode #medium #success

## Question
You are given two **non-empty** [[ðŸ‘“ Learning/Data Structures/Linked List|linked lists]] representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sumÂ as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

###### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/02/addtwonumber1.jpg)

```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

###### Example 2:
```
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

###### Example 3:
```
**Input:** l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
**Output:** [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```

###### Constraints:
-   The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
-   `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
-   It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

---
## Solution
### Initial Solution
- Each linked list stores a number in reverse order, meaning the first element of the linked list is the least significant digit. Carry over from the sum (sum >10) is therefore passed to the next sum of the nodes.
- We need to traverse the linked list, adding the nodes as we go. 
- The resulting linked list can be **larger** than the longest input list due to carry over of the remainder

```typescript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     val: number
 *     next: ListNode | null
 *     constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
 *         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *         this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 *     }
 * }
 */

function addTwoNumbers(l1: ListNode | null, l2: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {
	// initialize variables
    let lsum = new ListNode();
    let head = lsum;	// this is an like a pointer to the start of lsum
    let sum = 0;
    let carry = 0;

	// loop through input linked lists
    while (l1 != null || l2 != null) {
        sum = (l1==null ? 0 : l1.val) + (l2==null ? 0 : l2.val) + carry;
        
		// update carry if necessary
        if (sum > 9) {
            carry = 1;
            sum = sum - 10;
        } else {
            carry = 0;
        }
        
        lsum.next = new ListNode(sum);      
        lsum = lsum.next;
        l1 = l1?.next;
        l2 = l2?.next;
    }
        
	// one last check to see if we need to add an extra node due to carry
    if (carry > 0)
        lsum.next = new ListNode(carry);
        
    return head.next;
};
```

### LeetCode Solution: Elementary Math
###### Intuition
Keep track of the carry using a variable and simulate digits-by-digits sum starting from the head of list, which contains the least-significant digit.

###### Algorithm
Just like how you would sum two numbers on a piece of paper, we begin by summing the least-significant digits, which is the head of $l1$ and $l2$. Since each digit is in the range of $0 \ldots 9$ summing two digits may "overflow". For example $5 + 7 = 12$. In this case, we set the current digit to 2 and bring over the $carry = 1$ to the next iteration. $carry$ must be either 0 or 1 because the largest possible sum of two digits (including the carry) is 9 + 9 + 1 = 19.

###### Implementation
```typescript
function addTwoNumbers(l1: ListNode | null, l2: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {
	let dummyHead = new ListNode(0);
	let curr = dummyHead;
	let carry = 0;
	
	while (l1 != null || l2 != null || carry != 0) {
		let x = (l1 != null) ? l1.val : 0;
		let y = (l2 != null) ? l2.val : 0;
		let sum = carry + x + y;
		carry = parseInt(sum / 10);
		curr.next = new ListNode(sum % 10);
		curr = curr.next;
		if (l1 != null)
			l1 = l1.next;
		if (l2 != null)
			l2 = l2.next;
	}
	return dummyHead.next;
}
```
