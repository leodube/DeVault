## Interesting Points
- Injury statistics indicate the annual risk of injury to a planter is as high as 75% in accidents which often incur multiple injuries.
- A study found that subjects adjusted their walking pace at a constant energy output of $425 kcal/hr \pm 10$% to accommodate imperceptibly varying treadmill speeds. This suggests that individuals adjust their rate of work in order to maintain a constant work output (work pace) in the presence of a changing task loas.
