>Tree-planting demands sustained high work-output and is associated with high injury rates but has not been characterized previously. Data were collected from 10 male planters after 19  5 (T1) and 37  5 days (T2) of planting. One severe infection and one knee strain injury were noted. Loads carried were 32%  5% body mass and heart rates were between 60% to 75% of maximum for 57%  26% of the planting shift. A loss of 1.7%  1.5% body mass occurred, although intake exceeded 5000 kcal/day.

## Introduction
- The strenuous nature of tree planting has been shown to load to immunosuppression, with a reduced ability of the immune system to effect tissue repairs after injury or to ward off infections when exposed to pathological organisms.
- This project proposed to characterize the occupation of tree-planting by determining fitness, dietary intake, blood glucose, body composition, and markers of inflammation, immune, and neoroendocrine systems as affected by the work of tree-planting.
