## Summary
The basis of the critical power concept is that there is a hyperbolic relationship between power output and the time that the power output can be sustained. Theoretically, the power asymptote of the relationship, CP (critical power), can be sustained without fatigue; in fact, exhaustion occurs after about 30 to 60 minutes of exercise at CP. Nevertheless, CP is related to the fatigue threshold, the ventilatory and lactate threshold, and maximum oxygen intake, and it provides a measure of aerobic fitness.

## The Critical Power Concept
- CP has been identified as the maximum rate that could be sustained 'for a very long time without fatigue', and it was suggested that 'when the imposed power is inferior or equal to the critical power,... exhaustion cannot occur'.
