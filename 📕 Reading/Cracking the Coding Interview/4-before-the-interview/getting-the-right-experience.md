# Getting the Right Experience

Although offer decisions are typically based more on the interview than anything else, it's your resume - and therefore your prior experience - that gets you the interview. You should think actively about how to enhance your technical (and non-technical) experience. 

For professionals, if you're trying to move from a lesser known company to one of the "biggies", or from testing / IT into a dev role, the following advice will be useful:
- *Shift work responsibilities more towards coding:* As much as possible, try to take on bigger coding challenges that lend themselves well to a resume bullet or two. Use relvant technologies.
- *Use your nights and weekends:* If you have some free time, use it to build a mobile app, a web app, or a piece of desktop software. Doing such projects is also a great way to get experience with new technologies, making you more relevant to today's companies. This project work should definitely be listed on your resume; few things are as impressive to an interviewer as a candidate who built something "just for fun".

All these boil down to the two big things that companies want to see: that you're smart and that you can code. If you can prove that, you can land your interview.
