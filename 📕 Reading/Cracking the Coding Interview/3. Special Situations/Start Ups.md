# Start Ups
#reading #cracking-the-coding-interview

The application and interview process for start-ups is highly variable.

##### The Applications Process
Many start-ups might post job listings, but often the best way in is through a personal referral. This referrer doesn't necessarily need to be a close friend or a coworker. Often just by reaching out and expressing your interest, you can get someone to pick up your resume to see if you're a good fit.

##### Visas and Work Authorization
Unfortunately, most smaller start-ups in the U.S. are not able to sponsor work visas. Your best bet is to reach out to a professional recruiter who works with many start-ups.

##### Resume Selection Factors
Start-ups are engineers who are not only smart and can code, but also people who would work well in an entrepreneurial environment. Your resome should ideally show initiative. Being able to hit the ground running is also very important; they want people who already know the language of the company

##### The Interview Process
In contrast to big companies, which tend to look mostly at your general aptitude with respect to software development, start-ups often look closely at your personality fit, skill set, and prior experience.

- *Personality fit:* Typically assessed by how you interact with your interviewer. Establishing a friendly, engaging conversation with your interviewers is your ticket to many job offers
- *Skill set:* Likely to assess your skills with specific programming languages. If you know a language that the start-up works with, make sure to brush up on the details.
- *Prior Experience:* Start-ups are likely to ask you a lot of questions about your prior experience. Pay special attention to the [[ðŸ“• Reading/Cracking the Coding Interview/5. Behavioural Questions/Behavioural Preparation|Behavioural Questions]] section
