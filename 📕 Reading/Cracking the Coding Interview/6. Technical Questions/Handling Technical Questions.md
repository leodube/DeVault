# Handling Technical Questions
#reading #cracking-the-coding-interview #interview

Interviews are supposed to be difficult, so when you get a hard questions, don't panic. Just start talking aloud about how you would solve it. Show your interviewer how you're tackling the problem so that they don't think you're stuck.

You're not done until the interviewer says you're dont. When you come up with an algorithm, start thinking about the problems accompanying it. When you write code, start trying to find bugs.

##### Five Steps to a Technical Question
1.  Ask your interviewer questions to resolve ambiguity.
2. Design an algorithm
3. Write pseudocode first, but make sure to tell your interviewer that you'll eventually write "real" code
4. Write your code at a moderate pace
5. Test your code and carefully fix any mistakes

**Step 1: Ask Questions**
Technical problems are more ambiguous than they might appear, so make sure to ask questions to resolve anything that might be unclear. 

**Step 2: Design an Algorithm**
It's perfectly acceptable, and even recommended, to first mention the brute force solution. You can then continue to optimize from there.

**Step 3: Pseudocode**
Writing pseudocode first can help you outline your thoughts clearly and reduce the number of mistakes you commit.

**Step 4: Code**
Where relevant, use a good data structure or define your own.

**Step 5: Test**
Consider testing extreme cases, user errors, and general cases. When you find mistakes, carefully think through why the bug is occuring before fixing the mistake. You do not want to be seen as a "random fixer" candidate.
