# Writing a Great Resume

Resume screeners look for the same things that interviewers do. They want to know that you're smart and that you can code.

That means you should prepare your resume to highlight those two things. 

##### Appropriate Resume Length
It is strongly advised to keep a resume to one page if you have less than ten years of experience. Long resumes are not a reflection of having tons of expereince; they're a reflection of not understanding how to prioritize content.

##### Employment History
Your resume does not - and should not - include a full history of every role you're ever had. You should include only relevant positions.

##### Writing Strong Bullets
For each role, try to discuss your accomplishments with the following approach: "Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to Z". Here's an example:
- "Reduced object rendering time by 75% by implementing distributed caching, leading to a 10% reduction in log-in time".
- "Increased average match accuracy from 1.2 to 1.5 by implementing a new comparison algorithm based on windiff".

Not everything you did will fit into this approach, but the principle is the same: show what you did, how you did it, and what the results were. Ideally you should try to make the results "measurable" somehow.

##### Programming Languages 
Knowing which languages to include on your resume is always a tricky thing. Do you list everything you're ever worked with, or do you shorten the list to just the ones that you're most comfortable with? Consider listing most of the languages you've used, but add your experience level:
- Languages: Java (expert), C++(proficient), JavaScript (prior experience).
