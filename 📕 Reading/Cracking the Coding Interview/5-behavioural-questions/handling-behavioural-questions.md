# Handling Behavioural Questions

Interviews usually start and end with "chit chat" or "soft skills". This is a time for your interviewer to ask questions about your resume or general questions, and it's also a time for you to ask your interviewer questions about the company.

##### Be Specific, Not Arrogant
Arrogance is a red flag, but you still want to make yourself sound impressive. Specificity means giving just the facts and letting the interviewer derive an interpretation.

##### Limit Details
Stay light on the details and just state the key points. 

##### Give Structured Answers
There are two common ways to think about structuring responses. 

*Nugget First*
Start your response with a "nugget" that succintly describes what your response will be about.

*S.A.R (Situation, Action, Result)*
Start off outlining the situation, then explaining the actions you took, and lastly describing the result.
