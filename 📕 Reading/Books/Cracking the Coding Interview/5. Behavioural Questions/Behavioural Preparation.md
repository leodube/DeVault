# Behavioural Questions
#reading #ctci #interview

Behavioural questions are asked for a variety of reasons. They can be asked to get to know your personality, to understand your resume more deeply, or just to ease you into an interview. Either way, these questions are important and can be prepared for.

##### How to Prepare
Behavioural questions are usually of the form "Tell me about a time when you..." and may require an example from a specific project or position. Consider filling in the following "preparation grid" as shown below.

|Common Questions|Project 1|Project 2|Project 3|Project 4|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Most Challenging|   |   |   |   |
|What You Learned|   |   |   |   |
|Most Interesting|   |   |   |   |
|Hardest Bug|   |   |   |   |
|Enjoyed Most|   |   |   |   |
|Conflicts with Teammates|   |   |   |   |

Along the top you should list all the major aspects of your resume, including each project, job, or activity. Along the sides, you should list the common questions. In each cell, put the corresponding story.

Consider reducing each story to just a couple of keywords that you can write in each cell. This will make the grid easier to study and remember.

If you're doing a phone interview, you should have this grid out in front of you. When each story has just a couple of keywords to trigger your memory, it will be much easier to give a fluid response than if you're trying to re-read a paragraph.

Consider extending this grid to "softer" questions. When answering theese questions, you're telling them about yourself. Think about what each story communicates about you.

##### What are your weaknesses?
Give a real weakness! A good answer conveys a real, legitimate weakness but emphasizes how you work to overcome it. For example: "Sometimes I don't have a very good attention to detail. While that's good because it lets me execute quickly, it also means that I sometimes make careless mistakes. Because of that, I make sure to always have someone else double check my work."

##### What was the most challenging part of that project?
Don't say "I had to learn a lot of new languages and tachnologies." This is the cop out answer and tells the interviewer that nothing was really very hard.

##### What questions should you ask the interviewer?

###### Genuine Questions
These are the questions you actually want to know the answers to. Examples:
1. *How much of your day do you spend coding?*
2. *How many meetings do you have every week?*
3. *What is the ratio of testers to developers to program managers? What is the interaction like? How does project planning happen on the team?*

###### Insightful Questions
These questions are designed to demonstrate your deep knowledge of programming or technologies, and they also demonstrate your passion for the company or product.
1. *I noticed that you use technology X. How do you handle problem Y.*
2. *Why did the product choose to use the X protocol over the Y protocol? I know it has benefits like A, B, C, but many companies choose not to use it because of issue D.*

###### Passion Questions
These questions are designed to demonstrate your passion for technology. They show that you're interested in learning and will be a strong contributor to the company.
1. *I'm very interested in scalability. Did you come in with a background in this, or what opportunities are there to learn about it?*
2. *I'm not familiar with technology X, but it sounds like a very interesting solution. Could you tell me a bit more about how it works?*
