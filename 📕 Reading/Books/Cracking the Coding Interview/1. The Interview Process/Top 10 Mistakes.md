##### #2. Not Rehearsing Behavioural Questions
Performance on behavioural questions might bias your interviewer's perception of your technical performance. Behavioural prep is relatively easy and well-worth your time. Look over your projects and positions and rehearse your key stories.

##### #5. Not Solving Problems Out Loud
Speak up often, and try to talk your way through a solution. This shows your interviewer that your're tackling the problem and aren't stuck. And it lets them guide you when you get off-track, helpinf you get to the answer faster. 

##### 6. Rushing
Take your time when working on a coding problem. Rushing leads to mistakes and suggests that you are careless. Go slowly and methodically, testing often and thinking through the problem thoroughly.

##### #8. Not Testing
When you finish writing code in an interview, "run" (or walk through) the code to test it. Or, on more complicated problems, test the code while writing it.

##### #9. Fixing Mistakes Carelessly
Bugs will happen. The important thing is that when you find a bug, you think through why it occured before fixing it. Bugs are acceptable, but changing your code randomly to fix the bugs is not.
